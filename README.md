Description:

This project is a lightweight web application developed in Racket, using a custom TCP-based HTTP server. The application provides users with a fun and interactive experience by generating a random surprise each time they click a button.

Key features include:

A random message display on /reveal, chosen from a predefined list of surprises (quotes, jokes, emojis, facts).

Clean and responsive design using embedded CSS for better user experience.

Stateless, repeatable, and dynamic behavior on each request.

The application showcases the use of:

TCP sockets and HTTP parsing

Functional programming in Racket

HTML/CSS generation directly from Racket code

Randomization and URL-based routing
